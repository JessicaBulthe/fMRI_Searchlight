B22: make_design_cv in combination with sets doesn't seem to do the right
job.

B21: decoding_write_similarity does not work for searchlight when only a 
subset of searchlights is written

B20: all values not shared between nested_n_vox and n_vox are automatically
removed. if cfg.feature_selection.nested_n_vox = 'automatic' is used,
this can make n_vox empty (thanks to Yuki for spotting this)

B19: output "other" generates an error when correlation_classifier is used.

B17: Online plotting doesn't work for passed data on simulated data when 
not all voxels are used.

B16: All methods that use current_data in decoding_transform_results 
assume that
(a) all used data is the same in all decoding iterations AND
(b) the data are not changed through processes such as feature_selection!
The latter problem can be solved easily if we assume that all data are used.
Then we just need to add current_data_used and combine data_train and 
data_test together. However, since this can vary, the only reasonable 
solution seems to be to pass data for all steps separately and to pass 
all indices for all steps, too, and put things together in the method that
transforms the results OR to carry out transformation already at an earlier 
step (which is not an option because of speed and many modifications)

B15: When data are scaled on the fly (e.g. for 'across'), this is not 
used in decoding_generate_output and thus may yield wrong results for 
methods that use data there

B10: Combination of scaling and parameter selection doesn't work, 
see run_nest in decoding_parameter_selection

B8: In the online plotting function, no brain is shown when ROI is used 
rather than searchlight

B7: When disconnected data are used with the online plotting function, 
they are not plotted correctly

B5: Using the CORRELATION CLASSIFIER (MVPA) with more than two trials per 
run generates an error. Need to correct the last line of MVPA and true 
labels or better make it possible to test MVPA trialwise, i.e. with more 
than one trial per run  (the correlation will be calculated with all left 
out trials, possibly  putting half in one and the other half in the other 
condition. 
Question: Then again what happens with unbalanced test data (which is 
valid).
