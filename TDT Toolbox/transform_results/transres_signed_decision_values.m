% function output = transres_signed_decision_values(decoding_out, chancelevel, varargin)
%
% Calculate signed decision values. This function outputs decision values
% of the classifier with negative sign for incorrect predictions and
% positive sign for correct predictions. The output can be understood as
% accuracy weighted by decision values, with an expected value of 0. In
% other words, it uses the size of the decision value as evidence weight.
% The more obviously correct samples will receive a higher weight than less
% obviously correct samples. This can be useful also when there are only
% very few test samples available to get a more continuous results measure.
%
% To use this transformation, use
%
%   cfg.results.output = {'signed_decision_values'}
